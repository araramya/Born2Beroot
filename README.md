This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.
You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox)
under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up
your own operating system while implementing strict rules.


Here is some commands that you can use in this project.

1) INSTALLATION (not graphical installation)
1.1. Hostname - yourintralogin42 example: araramya42
     Domainname - leave empty

     user_pass - some_pass

1.2. Partition setup
